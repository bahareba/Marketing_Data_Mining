# Analysis user behavior, fraud detection and ad network performance in an Android application
The data file is related to the user information of an Android application.Three types of analysis have been performed on these users:
1. Comparing the quality of users who have entered the application through different advertising networks. What percentage of them have done at least one in-app action within three days of installing the app? What is the daily return rate of users of each advertising network?
2. Investigate fraud in installing applications through various advertising networks. What is the statistical distribution of application installation hours during the day and night? What is the time interval between each user's events?
3. Compare feedback and value creation of each advertising network. How to evaluate them? Which network should we continue working with?
